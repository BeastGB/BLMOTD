hello everyone!

the new cities map is out and there is a horror mode which is still a work in progress and it will come out very very soon! there are also hit sounds now and moderators now have a new moderation tool! (if someone is claiming to be a mod, ask them to get the sparkler, tree, or one of the hammers)
I also want to mention that a lot more updates will be coming soon and maybe some more cool stuff! Go explore!

not everything has a hitsound yet so please point out what doesnt have some, most of cities doesnt.
